This project was performed by:

-Martin Ducros, Chalmers University of Technology

This repository contains the .py code and .ipynb notebooks for the music isolation project. Utilizing the structure of a U-net and transfer learning to islate vocals from .wav files.

The performance of the network is questionable due to the limited dataset used to in reation to the amount of parameters. The choice of transfer learning for the decoder part did not generate great results. The output of the network is comparable to hearing only vocals, but slightly noise corrupted.
